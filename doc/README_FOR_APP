ABOUT LINE ITEMS AND GRID ITEMS PARTIALS
We like objects to be displayed in some consistent way across the app. Views were generated for this purpose. It basically works like this:
You have an object, say an Item. In order to display it as a grid item, all you have to do in the view is
<%= render "as_grid_item", :object => @item %>
Or, if the view you're working on is not a child of the ItemsController,
<%= render "items/as_grid_item", :object => @item %>
There are a bunch of other options you can pass as well, but we'll get to those later.
The Items view partial items/_as_grid_item.html.erb sets up the variables and passes them all to shared/_as_grid_item.html.erb, which sets up the structure of the grid items.

Things to Keep In Mind:
1) if an object does not have a grid/line item partial in its views folder you can still call
  <%= render "shared/as_grid_item", :object => obj %>
  and it will make a grid item for the object.
2) You can substitute "line" for "grid" and make a line item.

Options You Can Pass:
Options are passed in the render line, thusly:
<%= render "as_grid_item", :object => @item, :link => false, :image => @item.headshot(:thumb), :line_1 => "foo" %>

OPTION  TYPE    DEFAULT*         DESCRIPTION
GRID OR LINE ITEM OPTIONS        
link    boolean false            Tells the partial whether or not to make the rendered item a link
href    string  url_for(object)  Tells the partial what the item should link to
image   string  ""               Sets up an image to show on the left side of the item
LINE ITEM OPTIONS
line_1  string  ""               the first line of the item
line_2  string  ""               the second line of the item
GRID ITEM OPTIONS
h1      string  ""               the h1 line of the item
h2      string  ""               the h2 line of the item
p       string  ""               the text below the h2 line
*Options default to the given value in the shared partial, but
default to something else in the model-specific partial

EXAMPLES:
in views/item_catgories/index.html.erb
<%= render "as_grid_item", :object => item_category %>
in views/items/show.html.erb
<%= render "as_grid_item", :link => true, :href => item_categories_path, :h1 => "&lt;&lt; Beginning", :h2 => pluralize(ItemCategory.parent_categories.count, "Category") %>
in views/groups/show.html.erb
<%= render "users/as_grid_item", :link => true, :object => position.user, :h2 => position %>
